#Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

This is a brief summary of the task.

#Description:

This project aims to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including details such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

#Overview:

This repository contains the code and documentation for performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into the data.

#Source: Kaggle

#Key Steps:

1) Data Cleaning:

>> Handle missing values through imputation or removal.

>> Eliminate duplicate entries.

>> Rectify data format inconsistencies (e.g., converting string values to appropriate data types).

>> Exclude irrelevant columns to streamline the analysis.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

>> Explore descriptive statistics of the dataset.

>> Visualize the distribution of numerical variables via histograms, box plots, etc.

>> Investigate relationships between variables using scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.

>> Analyze categorical variables using bar plots or pie charts.

>> Detect outliers or anomalies warranting further investigation.

#Dependencies:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:- pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,numpy.

#Conclusion:

Summarize the main findings and insights obtained from the data cleaning and EDA process. Discuss any notable patterns, trends, or relationships discovered in the dataset. Emphasize the importance of EDA in understanding the data and informing further analysis.
